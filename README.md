# Password Generator 

## Description 
This project is about creating an internet app that generates random passwords based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface which is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. The idea is to use the power of functions in JavaScript instead of writing repetitive lines of code and to make efficient use of some of methods avaialable to work with arrays. It uses the same logic that all of the password generators follow enabling them to generate random passwords based on a set of pre-determined criteria so you don't have to think about creating a secure password by yourslef which can be quite time-consuming and cumbersome. Doing the project helped me to be familair with the process of algorithm design from scratch, how to make arrays of character set codes using a custom-made function, how to concatenate those arrays to make composite arrays based on the selected criteria by the user, how to record users selections and how to develop a password generator function that gets all this info and picks random characters from those arrays using a for loop and returns a password. There are also some basic DOM element manipulation aspects that puts an event listener and runs the appropriate functions upon clicking the password generation button.

## Installation

This projec is an inetrenet-based app that runs inside the browser so you don't need to install anything. All you need is an internet browser to run the app. 


## Usage 

When you first load the page, it will show you a prompt that asks you to enter a number between 8 and 128. If you enter a lower or higher number than that it will keep showing you the prompt until you enter the correct number. It will then show you a series of confirm windows so you can choose among 4 criteria (having uppercase, lowercase, numbers or special characters in your password). You can choose them by clicking on OK or skip them by clicking on cancel. After you finish choosing your options, you can click on red generate password button on the page to see your randomly generated password. You can click on that button as many times as you want to have different combinations using the same rules you defined. At anytime, if you needed to define new rules for the password generation you may refresh the page to restart prompt windows.
